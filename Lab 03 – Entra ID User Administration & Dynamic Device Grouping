# Lab 03 — Entra ID User Properties & Dynamic Device Group (NYC Windows)

## Overview
This lab demonstrates hands-on experience with Microsoft Entra ID user administration and dynamic device-based group management. The scenario focused on creating a new user, updating identity attributes, and configuring a dynamic security group for Windows devices using naming conventions.

## Scenarios Completed

### User Administration
- Created a new Entra ID user (Greg Johnson)
- Updated core identity attributes:
  - Job Title  
  - Department  
  - Office Location  

### Dynamic Group Configuration
- Created a Security group with Dynamic Device membership
- Implemented rule logic to automatically include:
  - Windows devices  
  - With device names starting with **"NYC"**

## Skills Demonstrated
- Microsoft Entra ID user lifecycle management  
- Identity attribute configuration and directory hygiene  
- Dynamic group rule logic  
- Device-based access scoping  
- Understanding of identity-driven access control concepts  

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)  
- Dynamic Membership Rules  
- Device identity attributes  

## Evidence
Screenshots documenting each phase of the lab are stored in the `/screenshots` directory, including:
- User creation and profile updates  
- Group configuration and rule expression  
- Membership validation  

## Why This Matters
Identity is a core security boundary in modern environments. This lab demonstrates foundational IAM skills that directly support:
- Conditional Access policies  
- Application assignment and access control  
- Zero Trust architecture  
- Device compliance enforcement  
- Scalable identity governance
