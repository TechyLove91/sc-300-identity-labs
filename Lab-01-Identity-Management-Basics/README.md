# Lab 01 – Identity Management Basics (Microsoft Entra ID)

## Objective
Implement a basic identity management solution using Microsoft Entra ID by creating a tenant, provisioning users and groups, and preparing the environment for secure access controls.

## Environment
- Platform: Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Tenant Type: Workforce (Default Directory)
- Domain: shesbrittanygmail.onmicrosoft.com

## Tasks Completed
- Created and verified Microsoft Entra ID tenant
- Created administrative and standard user accounts
- Created security group for access management

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Identity lifecycle management
- User and group provisioning
- Group-based access control

## Skills Demonstrated
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant navigation and identity administration
- User lifecycle management (create/test accounts)
- Security group creation and access organization
- Lab documentation with evidence (screenshots) for portfolio readiness

## Lessons Learned
- Entra ID tenants represent organizational identity boundaries
- Groups simplify access management
- Proper documentation is critical for troubleshooting and audits

## Next Steps
- Apply Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as a security control in a dedicated Conditional Access lab
- Design and enforce Conditional Access policies aligned with Zero Trust principles
