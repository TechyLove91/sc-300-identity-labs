# SC-300 Identity Labs

This repository contains hands-on identity and access management (IAM) labs aligned with the Microsoft SC-300: Identity and Access Administrator certification.

## Labs
- [Lab 01 – Identity Management Basics](Lab-01-Identity-Management-Basics/README.md)

- [Lab 03 – Entra User & Dynamic Group](Lab-03-Entra-User-Dynamic-Group/README.md)


## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Identity governance and delegation

These labs are built using a combination of guided simulations and live tenant implementations to demonstrate real-world IAM concepts.
