# Lab 05: Implementing Secure Authentication with MFA, SSPR & Password Protection

## 🔐 Overview

This lab demonstrates the implementation of **modern authentication and identity security controls** using **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)**. The lab focuses on enforcing **tenant-wide Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, configuring **authentication methods**, enabling **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)**, and implementing **Microsoft Entra Password Protection** in alignment with **Zero Trust principles**.

This lab reflects real-world Identity & Access Management (IAM) administrative tasks commonly performed by Identity Engineers and Security Administrators.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Review and plan authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID
* Configure and enforce tenant-wide MFA
* Enable and manage authentication methods (Authenticator, TAP, Email OTP)
* Deploy Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)
* Implement Microsoft Entra Password Protection
* Validate security controls through user testing

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
* Microsoft Authenticator
* Temporary Access Pass (TAP)
* Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)
* Microsoft Entra Password Protection
* Zero Trust Identity Principles

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

* Microsoft Entra ID tenant
* Global Administrator role
* Two test user accounts
* Microsoft Authenticator app installed on a mobile device

---

## 🧪 Task 1: Review Authentication Methods

Reviewed available authentication options within Microsoft Entra ID, including Microsoft Authenticator, Temporary Access Pass (TAP), FIDO2 security keys, OATH tokens, and Email OTP.

## 🧪 Task 2: Configure Tenant-Wide MFA

Configured tenant-wide Multi-Factor Authentication to strengthen sign-in security.

Actions performed:

* Enabled MFA for all users
* Allowed Microsoft Authenticator as the primary method
* Enabled fraud alerts
* Disabled remembered MFA on trusted devices

## 🧪 Task 3: Configure Authentication Methods Policy

Configured and enabled authentication methods to support secure and flexible user authentication.

Actions performed:

* Enabled Microsoft Authenticator
* Enabled Temporary Access Pass (TAP) for onboarding and recovery
* Enabled Email OTP for guest access
* Scoped policy to all users or a designated test group

## 🧪 Task 4: Configure Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)

Enabled Self-Service Password Reset to allow users to securely reset passwords without administrative intervention.

Actions performed:

* Enabled SSPR for selected users
* Required two authentication methods:

  * Microsoft Authenticator
  * Email
* Reviewed password writeback status

📸 **SSPR Enabled**

## 🧪 Task 5: Configure Microsoft Entra Password Protection

Implemented password protection policies to prevent weak and commonly compromised passwords.

Actions performed:

* Enabled password protection in **Enforced** mode
* Configured custom banned passwords
* Configured smart lockout thresholds

📸 **Password Protection Settings**

---

## 🧪 Task 6: Validation & Testing

Validated security configurations using a test user account.

Tests performed:

* Verified MFA enforcement during sign-in
* Confirmed weak passwords were blocked
* Successfully completed SSPR flow
* Tested Temporary Access Pass during user onboarding

📸 **MFA Prompt During Sign-In**

---

## ✅ Results & Outcomes

* Tenant-wide MFA successfully enforced
* Secure authentication methods implemented
* Self-service password recovery enabled
* Password security strengthened using Entra Password Protection
* Configuration aligned with Zero Trust best practices

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* MFA is a foundational identity security control
* Temporary Access Pass simplifies secure onboarding
* SSPR reduces helpdesk workload while maintaining security
* Password protection significantly reduces credential-based attacks
