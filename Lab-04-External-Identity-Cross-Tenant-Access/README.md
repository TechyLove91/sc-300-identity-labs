# Lab 04 — External Identity & Cross-Tenant Access Configuration

## Overview
This lab demonstrates hands-on experience configuring external identity collaboration and cross-tenant access controls in Microsoft Entra ID. The scenario focused on managing B2B collaboration settings, inviting and managing external users, and reviewing cross-tenant access and synchronization configurations.

## Scenarios Completed

### External Collaboration Configuration
- Reviewed and configured external collaboration settings
- Evaluated guest user access restrictions and invitation permissions

### External User (B2B) Management
- Invited an external user to the tenant
- Validated guest account creation and user type
- Reviewed guest user properties and access scope

### Cross-Tenant Access Settings
- Reviewed inbound and outbound cross-tenant access policies
- Evaluated trust settings and access controls for partner tenants

### Cross-Tenant Synchronization Review
- Reviewed cross-tenant synchronization options and use cases
- Analyzed identity lifecycle integration scenarios across tenants

### External Identity Providers Review
- Navigated identity provider configuration options
- Reviewed federation protocols including SAML and WS-Federation

## Skills Demonstrated
- External identity and B2B collaboration management  
- Guest user lifecycle awareness  
- Cross-tenant access policy understanding  
- Multi-tenant identity architecture concepts  
- Federation and identity provider awareness  

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

## Evidence
Screenshots documenting each phase of the lab are stored in the `/screenshots` directory, including:
- External collaboration configuration  
- Guest user invitation and management  
- Cross-tenant access settings  
- Identity provider configuration areas  

## Why This Matters
External identities represent one of the highest risk areas in modern environments. This lab demonstrates foundational skills required to securely manage partner access, enforce Zero Trust principles, and maintain strong identity boundaries across organizational tenants.
